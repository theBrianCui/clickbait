# Clickbait

**Check out the [live demo here!](https://www.ismyinternetworking.com/clickbait/)**

A clickbait title detection algorithm using machine learning on the Microsoft Azure platform. Sample (training) data manually gathered in `sample.csv` from Buzzfeed (bait = 1) and other news sources (CNN, Fox News, ABC, BBC, etc., bait = 0). Heuristics generated by `processor.js`. Generate new sample data by adjusting `processor.js`, the titles in `sample.csv` and `titles.in`, and running

```
node processor.js < titles.in > results.out
```

and then moving the values from `results.out` into `sample.csv` which can be provided to Azure. For best results, I suggest training the model using a Boosted Decision Tree regression.
